I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics and Business at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, affiliated with the Barcelona School of Economics. My fields of interest are <b>empirical industrial organization</b> and <b>applied microeconomics</b>. 

Before joining UPF, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at Harvard Business School. I received my PhD from KU Leuven in 2024.

My work primarily investigates changes in market structure and strategic supply-side responses, with special emphasis on the role of advertising. Additionally, my research covers individual and firm decision-making in digital markets, where I have analyzed the digital gap and evaluated alternative policies in developing economies.
