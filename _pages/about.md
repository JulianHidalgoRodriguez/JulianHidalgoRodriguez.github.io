I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at KU Leuven  <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/ioleuven/home'>(IO Group)</a>. My fields of interest are <b>empirical industrial organization</b> and <b>applied microeconomics</b>. 

My research focuses on the empirical study of changes in market structure and strategic supply-side responses, with special emphasis on the role of advertising. In addition, my research covers individual and firm decision-making in telecommunication markets, where I have analyzed the digital gap and evaluated alternative policies in developing economies.

<b>Update:</b> I will be joining Harvard Business School as a Postdoctoral Scholar for the academic year 2024-25. In September 2025, I will join the Department of Economics and Business at Universitat Pompeu Fabra as an Assistant Professor.
