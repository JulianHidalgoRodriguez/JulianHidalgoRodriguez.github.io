I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at KU Leuven  <a href='https://sites.google.com/view/ioleuven/home'>(IO Group)</a>. My fields of interest are industrial organization and applied microeconomics. 

My research focuses on the empirical study of changes in market structure and strategic supply-side responses, with special emphasis on the role of advertising. In addition, my research covers individual and firm decision-making in telecommunication markets, where I have analyzed the digital gap and evaluated alternative policies in developing economies.
