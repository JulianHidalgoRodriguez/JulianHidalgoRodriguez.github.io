  author={Hidalgo, Julian and Sovisnky, Michelle},
  year={2023},
  abstract = {Due to global lockdowns driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, the pervasiveness of inequalities
  in digital access is more prominent. As a result, finding strategies to narrow the digitaldivide
  has moved to the forefront of public policy. We examine the impact of a demand-side
  intervention in Colombia to learn about what hinders low-income populations from adopting
  internet services. Our model allows consumers take-up choices to depend on the types of
  plans offered as well as how much take-up has diffused across their neighborhood. We find
  that increasing the plans available or the diffusion rate (via internet literacy programs)
  would increase adoption by more than a price subsidy and would be most beneficial to
  households in less technically savvy markets. Our findings suggest that pricing subsidies are
  effective in closing the digital divide, but that non-price policies are equally important.},

  title={Market Structure and Adoption of Internet Services in Colombia},
  author={Hidalgo, Julian},
  year={2023},
  note   ={A note},
  abstract = {This paper analyzes (i) how changes in market structure affect welfare and consumer choices,
and (ii) how the overall effect can be decomposed into two components: the price effect and
the product variety effect. I address this analysis in the context of the Internet services
market in Colombia and exploit the entry of a large telecom operator in 2008. I estimate
a discrete-choice demand model and use a model of oligopolistic price-setting firms to infer
marginal costs and, subsequently, to conduct various counterfactual predictions. The
empirical findings indicate that market entry increased the take-up of Internet services by
6 percentage points and rose consumer surplus by $7.2 million (23% of the sales in 2008).
The decomposition of the overall effect reveals that, on average, the price effect accounts
for 62% of the total effect whereas the remaining of the overall effect can be attributed to
the change of the menu of products offered by incumbent firms.},

  title={Subsidies, Speed and Switching? Impacts of an Internet Subsidy in Colombia <em> (under review)</em>},
  author={Hidalgo, Julian and Sovinsky, Michelle},
  year={2022},
  journal={under review},
  abstract = {Inequality in access to health, education, and employment opportunities is exacerbated in
  developing nations due to the uneven distribution of access to high speed internet connections.
  In Colombia, the government enacted a policy (in 2012) to subsidize internet fees
  for low income households to bridge the digital divide. The reductions were not granted to
  all plans and thus created incentives for consumers to switch between plans. We estimate
  a structural model of demand for internet connection plans, which we use to quantify the
  importance of switching behavior. We estimate the model using data on plans offered by all
  internet service providers to households in all socioeconomic (SES) groups across Colombia.
  Our results indicate that the subsidy caused a non-negligible fraction of low-SES households
  to switch internet plans - the majority of which switched to plans with lower speeds not
  higher speeds. Furthermore, the more wealthy households (of the lower SES groups) were
  twice as likely to switch plans than those in the lowest SES group. Our findings suggest
  that the impact, not only internet adoption, but also on switching behavior should be taken
  into account when formulating subsidies designed to bridge the digital divide.},

  abstract = {Often empirical researchers face many data constraints when estimating models of demand. These constraints can sometimes prevent adequate evaluation of policies. In this article, we discuss two such missing data problems that arise frequently: missing data on prices and missing information on the size of the potential market. We present some ways to overcome these limitations in the context of two recent research projects. Jacobi and Sovinsky (2018), which addresses how to incorporate unobserved price heterogeneity, and Hidalgo and Sovinsky (2018), which focuses on how to use modelling techniques to estimate missing market size. Our aim is to provide a starting point for thinking about ways to overcome common data issues.},
