  abstract = {Due to global lockdowns driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, the pervasiveness of inequalities
  in digital access is more prominent. As a result, finding strategies to narrow the digitaldivide
  has moved to the forefront of public policy. We examine the impact of a demand-side
  intervention in Colombia to learn about what hinders low-income populations from adopting
  internet services. Our model allows consumers take-up choices to depend on the types of
  plans offered as well as how much take-up has diffused across their neighborhood. We find
  that increasing the plans available or the diffusion rate (via internet literacy programs)
  would increase adoption by more than a price subsidy and would be most beneficial to
  households in less technically savvy markets. Our findings suggest that pricing subsidies are
  effective in closing the digital divide, but that non-price policies are equally important.},

  title={Market Structure and Adoption of Internet Services in Colombia},
  author={Hidalgo, Julian},
  year={2022},
  abstract = {This paper analyzes (i) how changes in market structure affect welfare and consumer choices,
and (ii) how the overall effect can be decomposed into two components: the price effect and
the product variety effect. I address this analysis in the context of the Internet services
market in Colombia and exploit the entry of a large telecom operator in 2008. I estimate
a discrete-choice demand model and use a model of oligopolistic price-setting firms to infer
marginal costs and, subsequently, to conduct various counterfactual predictions. The
empirical findings indicate that market entry increased the take-up of Internet services by
6 percentage points and rose consumer surplus by $7.2 million (23% of the sales in 2008).
The decomposition of the overall effect reveals that, on average, the price effect accounts
for 62% of the total effect whereas the remaining of the overall effect can be attributed to
the change of the menu of products offered by incumbent firms.},
