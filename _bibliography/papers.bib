  title={This Craft's For You! Entry and Market(ing) Competition in the U.S. Beer Industry <br> <font size="4">Job Market Paper</font>},
  author={Hidalgo, Julian},
  year={2023},
  abstract = {This paper studies the advertising response to the entry of craft brewers in the U.S. beer industry. Exploiting changes in local beer legislation and spatial variation across TV markets, I document two facts: mass-producing brewers respond by raising local advertising, and this reduces consumers' price sensitivity. I then evaluate the implications for market power, using a structural model with persuasive advertising. The empirical model establishes that mass-producing brewers indeed had a profit incentive to respond to entry by raising advertising. Furthermore, the empirical results imply that (i) own and rival advertising can reduce price sensitivity; (ii) markups for flagship domestic brands increased from 2.6 to 3.4 for 2011-2016; and (iii) about 20\% of the rising markup can be attributed to the observed increase in advertising stock, which is partly due to the advertising response to craft entry.},

  title={Internet (Power) to the People: How to Bridge the Digital Divide},
  author={Hidalgo, Julian and Sovisnky, Michelle},
  year={2023},
  journal ={CEPR Discussion Paper No. 18354},
  abstract = {Due to global lockdowns driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, the pervasiveness of inequalities in digital access is more salient. As a result, finding strategies to narrow the digital divide has moved to the forefront of public policy. We examine the impact of a pricing subsidy in Colombia to learn about what hinders low-income populations from adopting internet services. Our model allows take-up to depend on the types of plans offered as well as the rate of diffusion in the neighborhood. We find that increasing the diffusion rate (via internet literacy programs) is more beneficial to takeup among households in the lowest socioeconomic markets and in less technically savvy markets relative to a pricing subsidy. Pricing subsidies reduce the digital divide by 13\% points but over half of that is due to the impact on the diffusion rate. Our results suggest that non-price policies are equally important to bridge the digital divide.},

  title={Market Structure and Adoption of Internet Services in Colombia},
  author={Hidalgo, Julian},
  year={2023},
  note   ={<em> Recipient of the CRESSE & CPI 2023 Best Digital Economy Paper Award for Young Researchers.</em>},
  abstract = {This paper analyzes (i) how changes in market structure affect welfare and consumer choices,
and (ii) how the overall effect can be decomposed into two components: the price effect and
the product variety effect. I address this analysis in the context of the Internet services
market in Colombia and exploit the entry of a large telecom operator in 2008. I estimate
a discrete-choice demand model and use a model of oligopolistic price-setting firms to infer
marginal costs and, subsequently, to conduct various counterfactual predictions. The
empirical findings indicate that market entry increased the take-up of Internet services by
6 percentage points and rose consumer surplus by $7.2 million (23% of the sales in 2008).
The decomposition of the overall effect reveals that, on average, the price effect accounts
for 62% of the total effect whereas the remaining of the overall effect can be attributed to
the change of the menu of products offered by incumbent firms.},

  title={Subsidies, Speed and Switching? Impacts of an Internet Subsidy in Colombia},
  author={Hidalgo, Julian and Sovinsky, Michelle},
  year={2023},
  journal={Review of Industrial Organization (Forthcoming)},
  abstract = {Inequality in access to health, education, and employment opportunities is exacerbated in
  developing nations due to the uneven distribution of access to high speed internet connections.
  In Colombia, the government enacted a policy (in 2012) to subsidize internet fees
  for low income households to bridge the digital divide. The reductions were not granted to
  all plans and thus created incentives for consumers to switch between plans. We estimate
  a structural model of demand for internet connection plans, which we use to quantify the
  importance of switching behavior. We estimate the model using data on plans offered by all
  internet service providers to households in all socioeconomic (SES) groups across Colombia.
  Our results indicate that the subsidy caused a non-negligible fraction of low-SES households
  to switch internet plans - the majority of which switched to plans with lower speeds not
  higher speeds. Furthermore, the more wealthy households (of the lower SES groups) were
  twice as likely to switch plans than those in the lowest SES group. Our findings suggest
  that the impact, not only internet adoption, but also on switching behavior should be taken
  into account when formulating subsidies designed to bridge the digital divide.},

  abstract = {Often empirical researchers face many data constraints when estimating models of demand. These constraints can sometimes prevent adequate evaluation of policies. In this article, we discuss two such missing data problems that arise frequently: missing data on prices and missing information on the size of the potential market. We present some ways to overcome these limitations in the context of two recent research projects. Jacobi and Sovinsky (2018), which addresses how to incorporate unobserved price heterogeneity, and Hidalgo and Sovinsky (2018), which focuses on how to use modelling techniques to estimate missing market size. Our aim is to provide a starting point for thinking about ways to overcome common data issues.},

# Work in Progress
@unpublished{hidalgo2023beeradvertising,
  title={Quality Labels for Internet Services},
  author={Hidalgo, Julian and Clavijo, Renzo},
  year={2023},
  abstract = {Policymakers often use labels to address important informational asymmetries about productsâ€™ quality. In the context of Internet adoption, speed labels (e.g., high vs low speed) help consumers to make informed choices, increasing the adoption of high speed services. This is particularly important in countries where the digital gap is still a first-order concern. These speed labels, however, may also give Internet providers incentives to adjust the portfolio of Internet plans, changing the competitive conditions in the market. Whether speed labels are good for consumers and for addressing the digital divide depends on the equilibrium effects of such policies.
  We analyze a regulation in Colombia that mandates high-speed labels (broadband) on Internet plans that exceed certain speed thresholds. Preliminary evidence suggests that Internet providers change plans such that there is bunching at the speed threshold. This change, in turn, intensifies price competition for plans at the threshold, drawing consumers from both low-speed and very-high speed segments. To evaluate the welfare effects of the regulation, we estimate a structural model with endogenous speed and price decisions. We find that while consumers value high-speed plans, this valuation increases substantially with the speed labels. On the supply side, the provision of speed is costly for firms. (In progress) We use the model to study alternative policies: no speed label, implementation of multiple speed labels (e.g., low, high and very-high speed labels), and the design of optimal label.},

  title={Telecom Market Power},
  author={Hidalgo, Julian and Canzian, Giulia and Verboven, Frank},
  year={2023},
  abstract = {We analyze and document the evolution of markups for European telecom operators since 1998. Using operator-country level unconsolidated financial data, we estimate markups following the production approach proposed by De Loecker and Warzynski (2012). While the aggregate average markup has remained relatively stable at around 2 over 1998-2020, we find that there has been considerable fluctuation over time. At the beginning of the 2000s, markups start to rise from 1.9 to just below 2.6 in 2011. Next, during the 2010s, there is first a sharp decrease in aggregate market power,  followed by a pronounced increase starting around 2015. We also find considerable heterogeneity in markups both across European countries and operators. The next step is to analyze the determinants of markup differences across European telecom markets (Work in progress).},
